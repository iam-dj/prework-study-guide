# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to assist me, the bootcamp coder, in preparing for four key sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The guide allowed for active learning and practice, and helped organize and memorize important concepts. Overall, building a study guide for these sections is beneficial for my success in the Prework module of this coding bootcamp, and this particular guide covered the basics of each topic.

## Usage

This study guide is designed to assist bootcamp coders in studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each section provides detailed notes on a specific topic, and the guide suggests one topic to study first to help with time management and focused learning. The guide also utilizes the DevTools console to provide a hands-on learning experience with JavaScript. 

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
